                YuYu is a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in
                economics with a minor in informatics, data science, and
                entrepreneurship. YuYu is one of the student-leads. The SUB
                Initiative was born from ReThink UW to create a sustainable but
                cross-disciplinary project that would engage their three central
                values: business, sustainability, and technology. <br />
                Her responsibilities involve team-management, goal-setting, and
                communicating with stakeholders. One way she incorporates
                sustainability in her everyday life is by reducing the use of
                single-waste plastics.

                Aditi Joshi is a second-year undergraduate majoring in computer
                science and minoring in environmental studies. For Aditi, the
                SUB initiative is an opportunity to work on big-scale projects
                while exploring how technology can instigate positive ecological
                outcomes. <br />
                Her primary responsibility is to work with the development team
                to create backend pipelines to display all of the business
                information on the website. Additionally, she also works on the
                landing page. To help mitigate environmental damage, she has
                switched to using soap bars instead of the bottled ones that
                produce unnecessary waste.

                Julius is a first-year undergraduate student who is planning to

                the SUB initiative appealed to him. <br />
                His responsibility as a front-end developer is to optimize the
                website’s client-side by making an interactive user interface
                with JavaScript and React. On the side, he also helps to set up

                others with diverse backgrounds. <br />
                His primary responsibility is to help with branding through

                traffic to the team’s platforms. A small lifestyle change that
